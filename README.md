## Getting Started

TODO: Add requirements

## Using the Code

Each table and figure has a corresponding script in the root folder that generates the appropriate result or plot.

### Simplified Simulated example

You may find a self contained simulated example of this algorithm here: `simulation/self_contained_simulated_example.py`
It simulates one lighthouse basestation looking down at two circles, and uses them to correct the perspective distortion.
